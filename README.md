# ⚡ Energy Consumption Forecasting Internship Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the work I completed during my internship at **INVETIA** under the mentorship of **Mr. Depanshu Lodhi**.  
The project focused on forecasting **kWh energy consumption** for accounts on given dates using historical consumption data and external weather features.
